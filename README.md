# CollegeAttendance

This android application has 2 main objectives:
1- A teacher can sign up his/her subject, and sign in to view the students in his/her class and modify their attendance.

2- A student can sign up for their subjects and sign in to view thier attendance in that subject.

The application is a working prototype which only allows teachers from 1 semester to sign up and we have only set up 2 branches.
